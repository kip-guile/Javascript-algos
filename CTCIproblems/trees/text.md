- In a perfect binary tree, there's no node with one child. Every node has zero or two children. Also, all the bottom nodes are completely filled.

* Perfect binary tree is very efficient because the number of total nodes on each level doubles as we move down the tree. Also, the number of nodes on the last level is equal to the sum of all the nodes above it plus 1.

- A full buinary tree means a node never has just one child
